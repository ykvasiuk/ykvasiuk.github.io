I am a theoretical and computational cosmologist developing novel statistical and machine-learning tools to address the fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the Universe. Since Summer 2021, I am a member of [Prof. MÃ¼nchmeyer's group](https://munchmeyer.physics.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have been working on the development of the better methods to analyse cosmological data from the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure surveys. Besides physics, I am broadly interested in AI and the possibilities it offers for the advancement of the scientific discovery. Check out my research projects [here!](/projects)
