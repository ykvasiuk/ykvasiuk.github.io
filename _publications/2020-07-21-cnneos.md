abstract: "Convolutional Neural Nets, which is a powerful method of Deep Learning,
is applied to classify equation of state of heavy-ion collision event generated within the
UrQMD model. Event-by-event transverse momentum and azimuthal angle distributions of
protons are used to train a classifier. An overall accuracy of classification of 98% is reached
for Au+Au events at âˆšsNN = 11 GeV. Performance of classifiers, trained on events at
different colliding energies, is investigated. Obtained results indicate extensive possibilities
of application of Deep Learning methods to other problems in physics of heavy-ion collisions."
