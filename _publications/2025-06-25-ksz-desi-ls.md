abstract: "We perform kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction on data from ACT DR6 and DESILS DR9. To estimate the cross-power between kSZ velocity reconstruction and galaxy density, we make use of a novel quadratic maximum likelihood QML power spectrum estimator implementation in red-shift binned spherical coordinates. We find a detection of the kSZ signal from the cross-correlation between the estimated velocity field and the large-scale galaxy field of 11.7σ. We estimate an amplitude A = 0.39±0.04 of the kSZ signal with respect to a halo model prediction, possibly indicating a high feedback in massive halos, in agreement with previous studies. Our result demonstrates the feasibility of an optimal QML pipeline at the resolution required for this analysis, and will be a powerful tool for kSZ cosmology with upcoming high-resolution surveys."
